# nodejs_intermediate_testing_and_code_quality

## Overview

A maintainable codebase should have clean and easy-to-manage code. In this training was explored how to gauge quality, implement testing, and measure code coverage in your Node.js apps.

To help you better understand these key concepts, walked through how to clean up a buggy restaurant booking app.

First, reviewed testing and code quality fundamentals.

Next, reviewed how to find errors by linting your code base, and explores different testing frameworks and their components.

Finally, demonstrated how to write unit and functional tests to exercise the code base, then determine what code was executed with a code coverage report.
